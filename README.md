# fract-ol – Fractal Rendering in C

## Description

**fract-ol** is a graphical application written in C that renders complex mathematical fractals using the MiniLibX graphical library.  
The program allows real-time zooming and exploration of fractals like Mandelbrot, Julia, and other custom sets.

## Features

- Rendering of Mandelbrot and Julia fractals (mandatory)
- Custom fractals (bonus)
- Interactive zooming, panning, and color shifting (bonus)
- Real-time rendering using MiniLibX
- Keyboard and mouse event handling

## Skills & Concepts Practiced

✔️ Mathematical computation (complex numbers, iterative functions)  
✔️ MiniLibX graphical library  
✔️ Real-time rendering and performance optimization  
✔️ Event-driven programming (keyboard/mouse hooks)  
✔️ User interaction in C graphical applications

## Why this project matters

This project introduced me to low-level graphics rendering, user input handling, and mathematical visualization — useful foundations for game development, graphical tools, or scientific visualizers.
